# Applied Data Analysis project - Milestone 2

## Title


## Abstract


## Research questions 
1. Do celebrities have an impact on the stock market and, if so, how big is it?
2. If we can find an effect, does it work for the general case or only for some people?
3. Also, what kind of industry does it affect? Can we find substantial differences comparing, for example, between cryptocurrencies and insurance companies?
4. If there is an effect, will the company recover? If it does, how long does it take for the company to recover?
5. Can we predict if a quote will have an effect on the stock market?

## Proposed additional datasets
1. Twitter data
2. Stock data

## Methods 
1. NLP
2. Sentiment analysis 
3. LSTM


## Proposed timeline
Until 4th of November: 
1. preliminary exploration of Quotebank + write down a draft of the abstract
2. evaluate which stock data source to use
3. look for APIs to recover twitter data
4. decide NLP technique to use

Until 10th of November:
1. produce some statistics and plots
2. point out how to use the additional twitter / stock data
3. prepare data for different libraries / techniques

Until 12th of November:
1. Complete the assignment

## Organization within the team


## Questions for TAs
- Should we restrict to a few brands / celebrities? If so, how?

## General ideas
1. Elon Musk quotes
2. Signal vs Signal Advance (Elon Musk)
3. Are articles biased towards cases where celebrities' quotes do have an impact?
