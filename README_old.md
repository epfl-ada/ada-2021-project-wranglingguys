# Applied Data Analysis project - Milestone 2

## Title


## Abstract
Last year the Bitcoin course seemed to be highly influenced by Elon Musk. Can this pattern be transferred to other areas?
The main goal of this project is to examine if there is an effect of celebrities' statements on the stock market. When this hypothesis can be proved these follow-on questions will be answered. First the quantity of the impact will be analysed and if it can be seen as a general statement or only for specific cases. Moreover, an attempt is made to map the influence on various industrial sectors and the time it takes for the effect to be reversed.
For answering these questions NLP, Sentiment analysis and LSTM are used. The methods are applied on the Quotebank dataset, also Twitter and Stock data are taken into account. 
If there is a connection this can be very useful for financial analysis.

## Research questions 
1. Do celebrities have an impact on the stock market and, if so, how big is it?
2. If we can find an effect, does it work for the general case or only for some people?
3. Also, what kind of industry does it affect? Can we find substantial differences comparing, for example, between cryptocurrencies and insurance companies?
4. If there is an effect, will the company recover? If it does, how long does it take for the company to recover?
5. Can we predict if a quote will have an effect on the stock market?

## Proposed additional datasets
1. Twitter data
2. Stock data

## Methods 
1. NLP
2. Sentiment analysis 
3. LSTM


## Proposed timeline
Until 4th of November: 
1. preliminary exploration of Quotebank + write down a draft of the abstract
2. evaluate which stock data source to use
3. look for APIs to recover twitter data
4. decide NLP technique to use

Until 10th of November:
1. produce some statistics and plots
2. point out how to use the additional twitter / stock data
3. prepare data for different libraries / techniques

Until 12th of November:
1. Complete the assignment


## Meetings
1. 2/11/21 from 10a.m.
2. 4/11/21 from 10a.m. to 11a.m.

## Organization within the team


## Questions for TAs
- Should we restrict to a few brands / celebrities? If so, how?

## General ideas
1. Elon Musk quotes
2. Signal vs Signal Advance (Elon Musk)
3. Are articles biased towards cases where celebrities' quotes do have an impact?
