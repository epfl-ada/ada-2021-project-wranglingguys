Hillwood said it is set to build a 992,640-square-foot facility on speculation, or without any leases signed, on an 85-acre site it recently bought near interstates 55 and 80. The building can be expanded to as much as 1.5 million total square feet. Dallas-based Hillwood, led by Ross Perot Jr., is counting on continued strong demand for industrial space in the Chicago area after overall vacancy in the second quarter fell below 7 percent for the first time since 2001. Hillwood is emboldened after e-commerce giant Amazon recently leased a 746,772-square-foot warehouse the firm built on spec in the Laraway Crossings industrial park in Joliet. That had been Hillwood's largest project to date in the Chicago area. In addition to that warehouse, its second in Joliet, Amazon also has signed recent deals for large distribution centers in Romeoville and Monee.
